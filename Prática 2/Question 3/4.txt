XOR function

For:
x = (-1, -1) -> t = -1
x = (-1, +1) -> t = +1
x = (+1, -1) -> t = +1
x = (+1, +1) -> t = -1

Since our inputs are 1 dimensional, the hyperplane of the function is a point.


There isn't a weight vector that defines a boundary that separates the points.
By plotting the points the above statement becomes aparent.
